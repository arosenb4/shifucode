    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <p> Those claiming to be Shifu are possessed of considerably higher standards than typical programmers. The training is a great deal more intensive and much more exclusive. It is geared towards weeding out the weak. Overt displays of scripting ability,
      such as advanced BASH commands, Makefiles, and shell environments are focused on. The associated terseness is not so much a training method as a test of the initiate's dedication. </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <blockquote cite="http://" class="scroll">
      Something mysterious is formed, born in the silent void. waiting alone and unmoving, it is at once still and yet in constant motion. It is the source of all programs. I do not know its name, so I will call it the Tao of Programming.
    </blockquote>
    <pre> The Tao of Programming - <em>The Silent Void 1.1</em> </pre>
    <p>Shifu recognize mastery of their craft lie within techniques as opposed to tools. The wise programmer is told about Tao and follows it. The average programmer is told about Tao and searches for it. The foolish programmer is told about Tao and laughs at
      it. If it were not for laughter, there would be no Tao. </p>
    <blockquote cite="http://" class="scroll">
      The Tao gave birth to machine language. Machine language gave birth to the assembler. The assembler gave birth to the compiler. Now there are ten thousand languages. Each language has its purpose, however humble. Each language expresses the Yin
        and Yang of software. Each language has its place within the Tao.
        <br> <br>
        But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.

    <pre> The Tao of Programming - <em>The Silent Void 1.2</em> </pre>
    <p>In parallel to a writing system, to transmit their canonical teachings, knowledge is often transmitted by presenting examples of the Tao; either by illustration or analogies. </p>
    <blockquote cite="http://" class="scroll">
      The programmers of old were mysterious and profound. We cannot fathom their thoughts, ...
      Who can tell the secrets of their hearts and minds?
      <br> <br>
      The answer exists only in Tao.

    <h2> Exit Status </h2>
    <p>After studying studying the man pages, young foo was perplexed. </p>
    <blockquote class="foo" cite="http://">
      The man pages for echo describe an <em>Exit Status</em> ...
    </blockquote>
    <p>Before young foo could finish shifu typed in the terminal</p>

  EXIT STATUS
     The echo utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if
     an error occurs.

    <blockquote class="shifu" cite="http://">
      ... continue ...
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="foo" cite="http://">
      Shifu, how can I know the <em>EXIT STATUS</em>? Upon success, the program executes; upon failure it does not.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="shifu" cite="http://">
      Young foo, an <em>EXIT STATUS</em> is not associated with any single utility. It is a Yin paradigm within the Tao; each value assigned a purpose. Should one abandon context if in error?
    </blockquote>
    <p>Without speaking, master foo opened a terminal and typed</p>
<pre><code class="bash master-foo">
  > echo $USER
  master-foo
  > echo $?
  0
  > error
  sh: command not found: error
  > echo $?
  127
  > echo $?
  0
  > echo '$USER'
  $USER

</code> Determining an EXIT STATUS </pre>
    <blockquote class="master-foo" cite="http://">
      Young foo, return home, meditate on this example, and study <em>string interpolation</em>. Then you will be enlighted in the Tao.
    </blockquote>
    <p>After saying these things, master-foo returned <em>$HOME</em> as if he had never left.</p>
<pre><code class="bash master-foo">

cd ~
